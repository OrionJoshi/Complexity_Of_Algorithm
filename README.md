### Analysis of Algorithms

There are a number of important practical reasons for `analyzing algorithms`. The most straigntforward reason for analyzing
an algorithm is to discover it characteristics `in order to evaluate its suitability` for various applications or compare it with other algorithms for the same application.Moreover, the analysis of an algorithms can help us understand it better, and can suggest informed improvements.

#### Algorithm

An algorithm is a `set of instructions that can be executed in finite amount of time to perform some task`.Several Properties may be considered to determine if one algorithm is better than another.Which are as follows:

- Time taken by the algorithm to run.
- Space or memory it consumes while it runs.
